## Assembly
# 1s and 0s
This is Low Level we are seeing here, Let's give respect to all who make computers and machines.

## Projects

## [HelloWorld.s](https://github.com/imboowa/Assembly/blob/main/main.s)
When Assembly writes Hello World, guess computers can greet too. I found this out two months ago, 2025. I really knew less or little of registers `fast variables in Assembly`, pointers `point to a memroy address`, and memory addresses `"postal code" where values live`. I now see the knowledge from the CPU to the Python logic `print("Hello, World!")`. Using registers, memory address, and pointers in Assembly, I can make the CPU output hello world. The stack is the most efficient pop and push algorithm in my perspective. I know less of algorithms but this is magic, push and pop is the drill.

## [ForLoop.s](https://github.com/imboowa/Assembly/blob/main/start.s)
For loops are these counters on conditions that are true. So implemting such in **Low Level** is a thing that proves programming is logical. I just have to make a label `_main`.do something then `b _main` again. That alone, is a while loop because I do a thing without condition, could be `True` forever. For for loops, you must state a condition like do a while loop as long as this NCVZ flags, so just do `cmp X0, #n-times` and `beq _main` if Zero flag is set. That alone once agian is a for loop.

## [Logic.s](https://github.com/imboowa/Assembly/blob/main/hello.s)
This combines previous programs hence it has **pointers**, **memory addresses**, **for loops**, and **flags**. This helps to further explain that logic is programming and Mathematical. Just give it a go and thank me later.
